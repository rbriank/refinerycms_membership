Allows you to associate roles with users and pages.  Assigning a role to a page means only users with that role will be able to see it.

User roles are currently assignable via the user admin pages, but I wanted a simpler way to do it.

Still needed:
* Proper 403 page.  Right now, it 404's which is not correct.
* Members list based on a given role
* Roles management page
* Add :title to the User model so the engine will always use title
* Expand to other models

Check it out, use it, hack it and contribute back.
